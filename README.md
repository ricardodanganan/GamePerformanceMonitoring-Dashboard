## Introduction

The **Game Performance** & **IT Monitoring Dashboard** is my final year IT Management project, developed as part of my 4th-year finals project. This real-time monitoring and optimization tool is designed to enhance gaming performance by providing comprehensive system insights. It tracks CPU and GPU usage, temperatures, RAM consumption, disk activity, and network performance, ensuring gamers have a clear view of their system’s health. Equipped with threshold-based alerts, historical performance tracking, and Steam API integration, it helps optimize system resources, detect installed games, and provide tailored recommendations. Additionally, I am implementing an in-game overlay feature, allowing players to monitor system performance without exiting their game. Future enhancements include cloud-based monitoring, AI-driven game optimization, and multi-system performance tracking across LAN environments.

## Features

✅ **Real-time performance tracking** – Monitor CPU, GPU, RAM, disk usage, and network performance dynamically.  
✅ **System alerts for overheating & resource overuse** – Receive notifications when resource consumption exceeds safe limits.  
✅ **Steam API integration** – Automatically detect installed games based on the user's Steam library.  
✅ **Optimized system recommendations** – Suggest best performance settings based on game requirements and hardware specifications.  
✅ **Historical performance tracking** – Store real-time monitoring data in a local JSON file for future analysis.  
✅ **Cloud synchronization (Future Enhancement)** – Allow users to sync performance logs across multiple devices via cloud storage.  
✅ **Multi-system monitoring across LAN (Planned)** – Track performance data from multiple systems within a local network.  
✅ **In-game overlay (Planned)** – Display real-time system stats while gaming without exiting the application.  
✅ **AI-driven game optimization (Planned)** – Use machine learning to recommend system tweaks for better performance.

## Usage

### View system performance metrics in real-time
- **CPU & GPU Usage & Temperature**: Graphical representation via Chart.js.
- **RAM & Disk Usage**: Track memory and storage performance.
- **Network Monitoring**: Display ping and latency.

### Receive alerts when system thresholds are exceeded
- **Automatic notifications** will appear when CPU, GPU, or RAM usage reaches critical levels.
- **Audio alerts** will trigger for immediate attention.

### Use the game optimization module *(Upcoming Feature)*
- **Detect installed games** via Steam API.
- **Compare system hardware** to recommended settings.
- **Receive optimization suggestions** based on detected hardware and software.

### Access in-game overlay *(Planned Feature)*
- **Live stats inside your game** without minimizing it.
- **Toggle visibility via a hotkey** to enable/disable the overlay.

## ✅ Core Features of Iteration 1 Successfully Implemented

### 🔹 Live CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU Monitoring ✅
- Tracks real-time **CPU usage, CPU temperature, RAM usage, Disk activity, GPU usage, GPU temperature, VRAM usage, and Network Latency** using PowerShell scripts.

### 🔹 Real-Time Graphs (Chart.js) ✅
- Uses **Chart.js** to display performance metrics as **smooth, interactive line graphs**, updating automatically every few seconds.

### 🔹 System Alerts & Sound Notifications ✅
- Implements **toast alerts and warning sounds** when critical performance limits (high CPU/GPU usage, overheating, network latency) are exceeded.

### 🔹 Historical Data Storage (SQLite) ✅
- Stores real-time performance data in an **SQLite database** (`performance_data.db`), allowing users to track historical trends over **1hr, 12hr, and 24hr periods**.

### 🔹 Export Data (CSV & JSON) ✅
- Provides an option to **download historical performance logs** in **CSV or JSON format** for further analysis.

### 🔹 Historical Data View ✅
- Allows users to switch between **1hr, 12hr, and 24hr views**, dynamically fetching past performance data from the database.

## 🚀 Planned Features for Iteration 2

### 🔹 **Steam API Integration - Game Detection**
- Uses the **Steam API** to fetch a list of installed games, allowing for system performance tracking based on the user's active game library.

### 🔹 **Game Optimization Feature**
- Compares detected games with system hardware specifications and **recommends performance optimizations** such as adjusting resolution, background processes, and power settings.

### 🔹 Separate Electron Window for the Dashboard ✅
- The entire **Game Performance Dashboard now runs inside Electron**, instead of a web browser.
- This allows for **faster performance, better integration with system resources, and improved fullscreen support**.
- Users can launch the dashboard as a **dedicated app** using `npm run start-all`.
- This eliminates the need to manually open `localhost:5173`, making the experience smoother.


### 🔹 In-Game Overlay Integration ✅
- Successfully implemented an **Electron-based in-game overlay**, displaying **FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, CPU temperature, and GPU temperature**.
- The overlay stays **on top of fullscreen games**, providing real-time performance insights without needing to switch out of the game.
- Features include **adjustable transparency, always-on-top mode, and click-through functionality** to ensure minimal interference with gameplay.
- Future improvements may include **Steam API FPS integration or DirectX hooks for more accurate game FPS tracking**.

### 🔹 **Further UI Improvements** ✅
- Enhances **visual effects, animation smoothness, and responsiveness** for a **sleek, modern dashboard experience**.

### 🔹 Customizable Performance Alerts and UI theme 
- Future updates will allow users to **adjust threshold levels** for CPU, GPU, RAM, and network alerts, and toggle button for UI theme for the Dashboard.

## Deployment

### Railway.app Deployment Plan:

- Railway hosts both the frontend and backend together, eliminating the need for separate hosting services.

- The backend (Node.js + PowerShell scripts) only runs when needed to avoid exceeding Railway's free tier limit (500 hours/month).

- The frontend (React) remains always online while the backend starts only when accessed.

### Usage Considerations:

- Since this project is for a final presentation, the backend does not run 24/7 but is available on-demand.

- If the Railway free tier limit is exceeded, the backend will pause until the next billing cycle.

- To ensure continuous access, the backend should be manually started in railway app before testing or presenting.

### Future Scalability:

- If long-term usage is required, the backend can be migrated to a dedicated server or cloud-based hosting for continuous monitoring.

- Additional features like historical data storage and multi-system tracking can be integrated over time.
