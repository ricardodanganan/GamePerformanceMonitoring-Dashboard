## Introduction

## Introduction

The **Game Performance & IT Monitoring Dashboard** is my final year IT Management project, built to deliver real-time performance insights and system optimization for gamers.

It monitors key metrics such as CPU/GPU usage and temperature, RAM, disk, VRAM, and network activity‚Äîensuring users can assess their system's health at a glance. With Steam API integration, the dashboard auto-detects installed games and compares system specs against game requirements, providing tailored optimization advice through AI-powered suggestions.

Users can export per-game performance reports as structured `.csv` files for external analysis or audit purposes. Advanced data visualization is supported via integrated **Grafana dashboards**, while historical tracking and threshold-based alerts enhance decision-making.

An in-game FPS and system overlay, powered by **Electron**, allows seamless performance tracking without leaving the game. The app runs as a standalone `.exe` file, offering a full desktop experience with no need for browsers or localhost environments.

## üîê Environment Setup

This project requires several API keys for integration with external services. To manage these securely:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend/` directory.

2. **Use the `.env.example` file** as a template. Copy its contents into your new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

3. **Replace the placeholder values** in `.env` with your actual API keys and configuration:
   ```env
   AZURE_API_KEY=your_actual_azure_api_key
   AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-azure-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
   DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name
   API_VERSION=2023-05-15

   STEAM_API_KEY=your_actual_steam_api_key
   STEAM_USER_ID=your_steam_user_id
   RAWG_API_KEY=your_actual_rawg_api_key
   ```

4. **Ensure `.env` is ignored by Git** so it doesn't get pushed to your repository.  
   Your `.gitignore` file should include:
   ```gitignore
   # Environment variables
   .env
   *.env
   backend/.env
   ```

## ‚úÖ Core Features of Iteration 1 Successfully Implemented

### üîπ Live CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU Monitoring ‚úÖ
- Tracks real-time **CPU usage, CPU temperature, RAM usage, Disk activity, GPU usage, GPU temperature, VRAM usage, and Network Latency** using PowerShell scripts.

### üîπ Real-Time Graphs (Chart.js) ‚úÖ
- Uses **Chart.js** to display performance metrics as **smooth, interactive line graphs**, updating automatically every few seconds.

### üîπ System Alerts & Sound Notifications ‚úÖ
- Implements **toast alerts and warning sounds** when critical performance limits (high CPU/GPU usage, overheating, network latency) are exceeded.

### üîπ Historical Data Storage (SQLite) ‚úÖ
- Stores real-time performance data in an **SQLite database** (`performance_data.db`), allowing users to track historical trends over **1hr, 12hr, and 24hr periods**.

### üîπ Export Data (CSV & JSON) ‚úÖ
- Provides an option to **download historical performance logs** in **CSV or JSON format** for further analysis.

## ‚úÖ Core Features of Iteration 2 Successfully Implemented

### üîπ Separate Electron Window for the Dashboard ‚úÖ
- The entire **Game Performance Dashboard now runs inside Electron**, instead of a web browser.
- This allows for **faster performance, better integration with system resources, and improved fullscreen support**.
- Users can launch the dashboard as a **dedicated app** using `npm run start-all`.
- This eliminates the need to manually open `localhost:5173`, making the experience smoother.
- **Optimized Electron Performance** by reducing CPU usage through background throttling, GPU acceleration, and efficient event handling.

### üîπ Electron Performance Issue & Fixes ‚úÖ
During testing, we observed that Electron's CPU usage **fluctuated significantly**, leading to performance concerns when running the overlay. The following optimizations were implemented to reduce CPU consumption:

**üîç Issue:**
- The Electron overlay would **consume high CPU resources**, especially when running real-time updates.
- `requestAnimationFrame()` **locked FPS at 60**, causing unnecessary rendering cycles.
- Background processes **kept running at full speed**, even when Electron was minimized.

**üõ† Fixes Applied:**
‚úÖ **Lowered data fetching rate** ‚Üí Reduced polling frequency for CPU/GPU stats to avoid excessive updates.  
‚úÖ **Optimized FPS counter updates** ‚Üí Limited `requestAnimationFrame()` calls to match actual game FPS.  
‚úÖ **Enabled background throttling** ‚Üí Prevented Electron from consuming CPU when minimized.  
‚úÖ **Forced GPU acceleration** ‚Üí Offloaded rendering to the GPU instead of overloading the CPU.  
‚úÖ **Improved overlay performance** ‚Üí Used `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, { forward: true })` to prevent unnecessary event handling.

After these fixes, **Electron now consumes significantly less CPU**, making the dashboard more efficient, even while running in fullscreen mode.

### üîπ In-Game Overlay Integration ‚úÖ
- Successfully implemented an **Electron-based in-game overlay**, displaying **FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, CPU temperature, and GPU temperature**.
- The overlay stays **on top of fullscreen games**, providing real-time performance insights without needing to switch out of the game.
- Features include **adjustable transparency, always-on-top mode, and click-through functionality** to ensure minimal interference with gameplay.
- Future improvements may include **Steam API FPS integration or DirectX hooks for more accurate game FPS tracking**.

### üîπ **Further UI Improvements** ‚úÖ
- Enhances **visual effects, animation smoothness, and responsiveness** for a **sleek, modern dashboard experience**.

### üîπ Grafana Optional View (Performance Monitoring Dashboard) ‚úÖ
- In addition to the built-in game performance tracking in the Electron dashboard, an optional Grafana-based monitoring view was implemented to provide a more   customizable and professional performance dashboard.

**What Was Done**
- Connected Grafana to SQLite:
- Used an SQLite data source in Grafana to pull system performance data directly from performance_data.db.
- Queries were structured using SQL to fetch time-series data.

- Created Real-Time Performance Panels:
- CPU Usage, GPU Usage, CPU Temp, GPU Temp, VRAM Usage, RAM Usage, Disk Usage, and Network Latency were displayed using gauge and time-series panels.
- Each metric was retrieved dynamically from the SQLite database.
- Added a Button to Open Grafana from Electron:
- A new button was placed below the "Toggle Overlay" button in the Electron dashboard.
- Clicking it opens the Grafana dashboard in a browser, allowing users to view a professional performance monitoring panel.

**How to Use**
- Start the Grafana Server
- Run grafana-server.exe (or the equivalent startup command in the Grafana installation).
- Open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to access Grafana.
- Ensure SQLite Database is Available
- The SQLite data source must be correctly set up in Grafana.
- Performance data must be actively logged into performance_data.db.
- Access the Grafana Dashboard from the Electron App
- Click the "View Grafana Dashboard" button to open the optional Grafana view.

**Why This Was Added**
- Alternative to Built-in Charts ‚Üí Allows users to leverage Grafana‚Äôs advanced visualization capabilities.
- Customizable & Expandable ‚Üí Users can modify and extend the panels without changing the core project code.
- Separate from the Main Dashboard ‚Üí Provides an alternative method to view system performance, rather than replacing the built-in monitoring.
